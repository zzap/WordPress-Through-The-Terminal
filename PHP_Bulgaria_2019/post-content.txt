Here is what we’re planning for our attendees this year!

<h2>2 Days of 3 Tracks of talks from 35 international speakers</h2>

Yes,  that is right! 3 tracks! We received so many good talk proposals, that we decided to invite more speakers than planned! We’re going to cover a broad amount of topics – Development principles, testing, architecture, good practices, some look on the management side, interesting news from the front-end world, anything of use for a PHP dev… Check out our amazing line-up of speakers HERE and sign-up to our newsletter to be the first to know when the full schedule is complete.

<h2>4 Classroom Workshops</h2>

On the Friday before the conference we’ll start with four trainings from 4 of the best trainers there are in the PHP world. Since, the capacity of the workshops is limited to 25 per workshop, tickets are sold separately.

<h2>Amazing Venue</h2>

We are going to be at Hall 3, Hall 3.1 and Hall 3.2 in NPC (НДК) – an emblematic place at the very heart of Sofia. Those are the halls that were used for Bulgaria’s EU Council Presidency. It’s located on the 6th and 7th floors with a panoramic balcony with view towards the beautiful park around it! The place is HUGE! Check out more about the venue HERE!

<h2>UnConf</h2>

Wanna present an idea, share experience, tell us about your open source project, practice a talk, let people know about anything you find of value – sign up for the UnConf and we will give you the stage. Sign-up for the UnConf will happen a little before the conference or at place! Sign-up for our newsletter, so you don’t miss it!

<h2>Exquisite lunch, catered coffee breaks and beverages</h2>

We’ve hired probably the best catering company in Sofia! They will deliver a culinary experience for every taste and all day catered coffee breaks! And because socializing is always easier over a beer… After lunch the  top quality beer is on us!

<h2>“Lazy” Track</h2>

Sometimes it’s nice to stay out and network for a little longer than a break. Or maybe just discuss the talks while they happen. Join the “Lazy” track – a special area where you can view the talks outside of the halls, play some games and have a conversation without disturbing others!

<h2>Saturday Evening Party</h2>

The most important part of a conference is networking! Our party is going to take place at our amazing venue right after the last talks on the first day! This is the perfect time to get to know your new friends better, reach out to our speakers and have a lot of fun! And again – catering and drinks are on us!

<h2>Games, raffles and awards</h2>

Developers need to have fun as well, because it can not be all serious
